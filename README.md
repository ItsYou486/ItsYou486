Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currenly training at ENI Informatique School to become a Web and mobile Web developer. I'm learning HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java and PHP/Symphony.

Before that, I worked for 5 years in a company that fights against food waste as an administrative assistant.

At the moment, I don't have any projects but in the future I'll post my first project and I'll very happy if anyone helps me improve my code.

If anyone has an idea for a project that's easy to make, I'd be delighted to work on it. 

See you soon!
